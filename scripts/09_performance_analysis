===============================================================================
Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To evaluate and compare the performance of business entities (e.g., products, customers, regions) over time.
    - To track growth patterns and seasonal trends using historical benchmarks.
    - To identify high-performing or underperforming segments.

SQL Techniques Used:
    - LAG(): Retrieves values from previous periods for comparison (e.g., previous month or year).
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes averages across partitions for benchmarking.
    - CASE: Implements conditional logic for trend classification (e.g., growth, decline, stable).

Recommended Use Cases:
    - Year-over-Year sales comparison
    - Month-over-Month customer acquisition trends
    - Performance scoring by region or category
